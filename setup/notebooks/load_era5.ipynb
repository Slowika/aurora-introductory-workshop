        "This notebook serves to subset and load ERA5 data from Google's public ERA5 analysis-ready, cloud-optimised (ARCO) mirror. Here, ERA5 data for the 1940-01-01 to 2025-12-31 period (continually, if irregularly, updated) at hourly frequency is stored in Zarr format. Beyond format, the sole difference between data available therein and that through the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) is variable naming: longnames are used in the former and shortnames in the latter.\n",
